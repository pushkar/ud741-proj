"""
This script demonstrates how to design the simplest recommender system based of
Collaborative Filtering. In order to make these predictions, we must first measure
similarity of users or items from the rows and columns of the Utility Matrix.
We will use the Pearson Correlation Similarity Measure to find similar users.

Use this template for Part 1 of your ud741 project.
Project Description is in http://goo.gl/9PGxtR
